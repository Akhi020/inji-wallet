## Support of credential format vc+sd-jwt

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the process for downloading and rendering an IETF SD-JWT VC, adhering to the OpenID4VCI specification.

### Actors involved
1. Inji Wallet
2. Issuing authority
3. _inji-vci-client_ (Library for downloading credential)
4. _vc-verifier_ (library for verification of downloaded VC)

###  Sequence diagram - download & view vc+sd-jwt credential format VC for Wallet Initiated Flow

  participant W as Inji Wallet (Mobile App)
  participant VCI_Lib as Inji VCI Client (Library)
  participant Issuer as Issuing Authority
  participant VCVerifier as VC Verifier (Library)

  W ->> VCI_Lib: 1. Get Issuer Metadata for given credential issuer
  VCI_Lib ->> Issuer: 2. Fetch Issuer Metadata (GET /.well-known/openid-credential-issuer)
  Issuer -->> VCI_Lib: 3. Return Issuer well-known metadata
  Note over VCI_Lib: Issuer Metadata is temporarily cached
  VCI_Lib -->> W: 4. Return Issuer well-known metadata
  Note over W: Cache the Issuer Metadata for future use
  W ->> VCI_Lib: 5. Download credential request from Trusted Issuer
  Note over VCI_Lib: Construct the request body for credential request
  VCI_Lib ->> Issuer: 6. Credential Request
  Issuer -->> VCI_Lib: 7. Return vc+sd-jwt format specific Credential response
  VCI_Lib -->> W: 8. Return vc+sd-jwt Credential
  W ->> VCVerifier: 9. Verify sd-jwt Credential
  VCVerifier -->> W: 10. Return Verification Result
  Note over W: If verification is successful, proceed to save the credential
  Note over W: Use cached Issuer Metadata for rendering
  

```

#### Steps involved
##### 1. Get Issuer Metadata

Establish communication with the _inji-vci-client_
Fetch Issuer Metadata

````
VCIClient.getIssuerMetadata(credentialIssuer)

Note: credentialIssuer is Credential Issuer Uri received from trusted issuers list.
````

##### 2. Fetch Issuer Metadata
The _inji-vci-client_ fetch issuer's metadata from issuing authority.

````
GET credentialIssuer/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer
````


##### 3. Receive Issuer Metadata Response
_inji-vci-client_ receives Issuer's metadata response.

````
{  
    "credential_issuer": "https://example.com/issuer",
    "credential_endpoint": "https://example.com/issuer/credential",    
    "credential_configurations_supported": 
    {
      "SD_JWT_VC_example_in_OpenID4VCI": {
        "format": "vc+sd-jwt",
        "scope": "vc_scope",
        "claims": {
            "cliam1": {
                "display": [
                {
                    "name": "Claim 1",
                    "locale": "en"
                }
                ]
              },
            "claim2": {
                "display": [
                {
                    "name": "Claim 1",
                    "locale": "en"
                }
                ]
              }
        },
        "vct": "SD_JWT_VC_example_in_OpenID4VCI",
      }
    }
}
````

##### 4. Return Issuer Metadata Response
Once the response is received in _inji-vci-client_, it is returned to the Wallet.

##### 5. Download credential request from Trusted Issuer

````
VCIClient.requestCredentialFromTrustedIssuer(
  credentialIssuer,
  credentialConfigurationId,
  clientMetadata,
  authorizeUser: () -> authcode,
  getTokenResponse: () -> tokenResponse,
  getProofJwt: () -> proof
)

Note: 
- credentialIssuer is Credential Issuer Uri received from trusted issuers list.
- credentialConfigurationId is one of the supported credential configuration id user has selected.
- clientMetadata for client authentication - client-id and redirect-uri
- authorizeUser is a callback function to authorize the user for the credential request and return authorization code.
- getTokenResponse is a callback function to get the token response from the authorization server.
- getProofJwt is a callback function to create the proof JWT for the credential request.
````

##### 6. Create Credential Request and send to Issuing Authority
_inji-vci-client_ will use `CredentialRequestFactory` and create `SdJwtCredentialRequest` request with following body:

````
{
   "format": "vc+sd-jwt",
   "vct": "SD_JWT_VC_example_in_OpenID4VCI"
   "proof": {
      "proof_type": "jwt",
      "jwt": "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6ZXhhbXBsZ...KPxgihac0aW9EkL1nOzM"
   }
}

````
and send it to the issuing authority.

##### 7. Receive the Credential Response
The _inji-vci-client_ receives the credential response as jwt string

```
"eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6ZXhhbXBsZ.eyJpc3N1YW5jZURhdGUiOiIyM.KPxgihac0aW9EkL1nOzM~disclousure1~disclousure1~"
```

##### 8. Return the Credential Response
Once the response is received in _inji-vci-client_, it is returned to the Wallet.

````
{
  "credential": "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6ZXhhbXBsZ.eyJpc3N1YW5jZURhdGUiOiIyM.KPxgihac0aW9EkL1nOzM~disclousure1~disclousure1~",
  "credentialIssuer": "https://example.com/issuer",
  "credentialConfigurationId": "SD_JWT_VC_example_in_OpenID4VCI"
}
````
##### 9. Perform vc verification

After obtaining the credential from the issuing authority through the _inji-vci-client_ library, a verification process ensures that the issued Verifiable Credential (VC) remains unaltered through _vc-verifier_ library.

_vc-verifier_ will use `CredentialVerifierFactory` and create `SdJwtVerifiableCredential` to perform validation and verification of the credential.

1. [x] Confirm the credential is not tampered. (Cryptographic Signature Verification)
2. [x] Disclosure Verification to confirm sd claims are not tampered. (Cryptographic Hash Verification)

````
VCVerifier.verify(
  credential: "eyJraWQiOiJkaWQ6ZXhhbXBsZ.eyJpc3N1YW5jZURhdGUiOiIyM.KPxgihac0aW9EkL1nOzM~disclousure1~disclousure1~",
  credentialFormat: "vc+sd-jwt"
)
````

##### 10. Return VC verification Result
After verifying the VC, return verification result

````
{
    "verificationStatus": true,
    "verificationMessage": "",
    "verificationErrorCode": null
}

````

- #####  VC Rendering:
  - Field Labels:
    The labels displayed for each field are derived from the Credential Issuer's metadata claims under the display attribute.
    Reference: OpenID4VCI Spec - Credential Issuer Metadata.
  - Field Ordering:
    - As per OpenID4VCI Draft 13, the order property in the issuerâ€™s well-known configuration defines the order of fields to be displayed.

This structured approach ensures that the credential is rendered accurately and efficiently while maintaining a lightweight storage and transmission footprint.
